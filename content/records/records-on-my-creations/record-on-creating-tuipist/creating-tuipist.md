# Introduction

I started my journey with keyboard layouts in 2022. The reason I switched from the 
traditional QWERTY layout to a Dvorak layout, was because I thought it would be cool to
be different. Little did I know, there was a community that cared about keyboard layouts,
and much more. So I started digging into it and went on to discover that a good keyboard
layout offers much more than just speed.

A good keyboard layout offers better speed, more flow between letters, and has less keys
so you fingers don't have to flail around trying to get to that one key in the corner. A
good layout will have you in the home row more often than not, and use layers to provide
access to modifier keys.

Going down the rabbit hole of trying different keyboard layouts, I never stuck
with any keyboard layout other than Dvorak. But I decided to try out the ISRT layout 
recently.
